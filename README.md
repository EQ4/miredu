MIR.EDU is an open source vamp plug-in which implements a basic set of 
descriptors useful for teaching MIR. The idea is to provide a simple library with clear and well 
documented code for learning about audio descriptors (RMS, log attack-time, spectral flux, etc.).

MIR.EDU is:
- open source
- simple to understand
- simple to build / install
- easy to visualise using Sonic Visualizer
- east to use for batch processing using Sonic Annotator

MIR.EDU is not:
- highly optimized
- comprehensive
- state of the art
